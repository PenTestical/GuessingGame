# GuessingGame
A guessing game as python script.

This is a possible solution for the following exercise:

"For this chapter the exercises all relate to adding additional features to the game:
  1. Provide a cheat mode, for example if the user enters âˆ’1 print out the number
  they need to guess and then loop again. This does not count as one of their goes.
  2. If their guess is within 1 of the actual number tell the player this.
  3. At the end of the game, before printing 'Game Over', modify your program so
  that it asks the user if they want to play again; if they say yes then restart the
  whole thing."
